# Talkeron

Talkeron is a UI application to manage and execute the scripted tasks.

## Features
  * Talkeron can be customized by adding new scripts for the desired tasks.

## Usage

For time being, Talkeron is only tested under macOS (10.13). You can build it in Qt 5.7.  

At the first running of Talkeron, a ".talkeron" directory will be created under the user's home, i.e. position indicated by "~". To save the time of customization, you can copy folders "Actions" and "Assists" under "/ext/" to "~/.talkeron".
