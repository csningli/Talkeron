<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>Comment</b>: Introduce the keys of developing and using of Talkeron.
<p>
Talkeron is a <b>console-gui-mixed</b> application for task management. In console,
user can type in the name of talkeron assists and running configured value of the parameters.
By clicking "Enter" key, the typed command will be compiled and start the task block of
the corresponding assist. In the task block, the default value of parameters are extracted from
the file which has the assist description, and it is replaced by the running configured value.
</p>
<p>
When an assist has been compiled correctly, a corresponding task block is created in the task area.
By clicking the buttons in the task blocks, user can start the corresponding action. There are
two kinds of actions: the binded actions "run", "redo" and "undo" of the assist; the hand actions which
link to other assists.

<b>Comment</b>: Introduce the commands acceptable by Talkeron console.
<p>
A command acceptable by Talkeron console has two parts:
<ol>
<li> <b>Assist indicator</b>. A dot separated string which indicates an assist. </li>
<li> <b>Running configured values of parameters</b>. A list of terms of format "[parameter name]=[running configured value]". This part is optional. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
the "Assist" directory under TalkeronHome.
</p>
<p>
For example, there is a built-in auxiliary assist
"Talk" which is described in file "TalkeronHome/Assist/Talk/Talk.talk". To refer to assist "Talk",
user can type "Talk" directly in the console. Furthermore, there is a child assist "Alist" in "Talk".
Assist "Alist" is described in file "TalkeronHome/Assist/Talk/Alist/Alist.talk",
and is referred by indicator "Talk.Alist".
