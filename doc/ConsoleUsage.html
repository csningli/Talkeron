<li> <b>Assist indicator</b>. A dot separated string which indicates an assist. </li>
<li> <b>Running configured values of parameters</b>. A list of terms of format "[parameter name]=[running configured value]". This part is optional. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>Assist indicator</b>. An assist indicator is actually the path of the assist description relative to 
the "Assist" directory under TalkeronHome. 
</p>
<p>
For example, there is a built-in auxiliary assist
"Talk" which is described in file "TalkeronHome/Assist/Talk/Talk.talk". To refer to assist "Talk", 
user can type "Talk" directly in the console. Furthermore, there is a child assist "Alist" in "Talk".
Assist "Alist" is described in file "TalkeronHome/Assist/Talk/Alist/Alist.talk", 
and is referred by indicator "Talk.Alist".
